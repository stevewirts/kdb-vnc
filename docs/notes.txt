yet another talk about an unusual usage of kdb :)

buried in various libraries for rendering UI
    I had a lot of exposure to OO ways of doing UI

visual works visual smalltalk 
    explains alot of my early style
    earliest form of 2 way binding
        value models
    1993
    gui and the data are 1
        value model/domain adaption

Ed Bierly said make something radically different

    QSP engine, dynamic server side q version of jsp engine
        sessions
        different variable scoping
        custom tags
        precompiled the pages

2004ish?
    how about we do everything in kdb? even the rendering?
    squeak smalltalk had a vnc server package that worked reasonably well,
    do this for kdb

my experience was with OO languages and libraries
    before I built the rfb/vnc server I needed
        OO system for the widgetry - o.q 
        lib for rendering - graphics.q
            graphics primitives
            simple geometry  
            font rendering support
        simple windowing system

o.q 

fonts.q 

graphics.q 

merge.q 

rect.q 

vnc_colors.q 

vnc_events.q 

vnc_utils.q 

vnc.q 


SHOW DEMO and CODE HERE

lessons learned
    maybe too much low level stuff done in q?
    use cairo and a real vnc server implementation
    john d'ausilio had been working on this
